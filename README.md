## Getting Started
This is 3 page HTML project consisting of index.html, portfolio.html & contact.html.
Each page has a consistent navigation bar and a sticky footer. Each page has a link to navigate to other pages. This project utilizes bootstap classes for building html wireframe, container, rows, columns etc.

## Running the Application

[The index.html page can be accessed via github page here](https://kaurshalpreet.github.io/homework2/index.html)

The index.html has links to my LinkedIn & Github profiles as well as my email address and Contact number. You can also navigate to portfolio and contact pages.

## Responsive Layout
The webpages are designed to be responsive for viewing on mobile devices. On an `xs` screen, content takes up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, some margins on the left and right sides of the screen will be observed.

When viewed on mobile device, the navigation links get collaopsed into a navigation icon. When clicked on the navigation icon, it displays the navigation menu.
